# Go Bots!

This is a repository where I will upload my bots developed with my [Telegram Bot's API library, tgbot](https://www.github.com/rockneurotiko/go-tgbot)

I'll try to have all the bots updated here, but if you see that there are someone that are not listed here, please, tell me ^^

You can talk to me in [telegram](https://telegram.me/rock_neurotiko)

# Bots (In any order)
